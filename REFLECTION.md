\# Cookie Clicker Reflection



\## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Seeing the text update immediately when I changed textContent helped the most, because it made the DOM feel like a live output instead of a separate file.



\## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I picked simple milestones that match the assignment suggestions, then tied each one to a tone change so the user feels progress.



\## What challenge or bug surprised you?

The most surprising issue was forgetting that the click handler only runs after the event happens, so I had to make sure the DOM elements were selected before adding the listener.



\## What personal twist did you add?

I turned it into a cat treat clicker and added background color changes at milestones.



\## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

Any app with buttons and live counters uses this pattern, like “like” buttons, upvote counters, and simple game UI interactions.
